## Description of the Project
This application can dynamically create a team profile generator, which it can add manager, enigneer and intern to the team profile. This application was tested using Jest (verison 24.9.0) while Node.js and Inquirer (verison 8.2.4) was used to run the application. This application requires you to understand package.json and its node_modules. In additon to that, gitignore file is important to use so certain folders and files are not upload to GitHub. For example, node_modules should not be uploaded to GitHub since this folder gets created during the installition process. Lastly, this project stands out since this application builds a index.html file dynamically, where the user can add more than one empolyee regardles of its role.


## Installation
To create this project, follow these several steps. This application uses Node.js and Inquirer (verison 8.2.4). Step one, download Node.js. Next go to the terminal of the index.js and type this command ```npm install```. This creates package.json file and inquirer@8.2.4. 


## Usage
To use this application, open the terminal, respective to the file. Run the ```node index.js``` in the terminal. Then, answer the following questions. Finally, the index.html will be created.
